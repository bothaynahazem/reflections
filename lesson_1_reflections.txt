The FC or diff cmds helped me see the differences by only getting the lines that changed and putting them between asterisks

Having the history of all the files that have been updated will help me when I need to go back to older versions to check for something I need that has changed


git log --> then press 'q' to exit
git diff first_commit_id second_commit_id
