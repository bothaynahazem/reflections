Finally working on GitHub !

I'd better push and pull commits manually in order to keep track of the changes I'm making and not leave it all to the computer
to decide which to be pulled or not.

fork --> means taking a copy of someone else's code and editing it on your own 

clone --> taking the code as it is on your local repository

branch --> when editing code, changing something, adding new features, etc.
